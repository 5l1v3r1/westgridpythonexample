# West Grid Python Example

This script is used to show how to go about running a python batch job on the West Grid clusters.

## Requirements

In order to run the script on West Grid you must have access to West Grid, and that is the only requirement.

## Running & Specifying Job Parameters

The following sections outline basic running of a job as well as specifying job parameters.

### Running a job
To run the example job use the following command
```
qsub batchjob.pbs
```

### Specifying parameters

To specify the timeout period (default 3 hours), memory used, and number of processors use the following command:
```
qsub -l walltime=hours:minutes:seconds,mem=<memory amoutn>mb,nodes=<node amount> batchjob.pbs
```

For example, this job runs for a maximum of 3 days, uses 1500mb, and uses 4 processors:
```
qsub -l walltime=72:00:00,mem=1500mb,nodes=4 diffuse.pbs
```

For advanced usage refer to http://www.democritos.it/activities/IT-MC/documentation/newinterface/pages/runningcodes.html

## Viewing Job Status

It is often necessary to view the status of jobs once they've been started.

### View all jobs
To view all jobs currently processing use the following command:
```
showq
```

### View your jobs
To view your own jobs use the following command:
```
showq -u username
```

### Example output
Once a job has been submitted, it will take a moment to be put into the Queue, here is an example of a task in the waiting queue:
